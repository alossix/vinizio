          Frascati is an Italian white wine named after the town of
          Frascati, located 25 km southeast of Rome, in Lazio, Italy.
          Archeological discoveries from the ancient town of Tusculum,
          now Frascati, demonstrate the cultivation of grapes for wine
          since the 5th century BC. It was one of the preferred wines
          of Ancient Rome, Renaissance Popes, poets and artists
          visiting in the Grand Tour 1700s and 1800s, and of the La
          Dolce Vita generation in the 1960s. Made from Malvasia di
          Candia, Malvasia del Lazio, Grechetto, Bombino bianco, and
          Trebbiano grapes, Frascati gained Denominazione di Origine
          Controllata (DOC) status in 1966 and DOCG status in 2011,
          making it one of Italy's first DOC wines. The Frascati
          DOC/DOCG area is located in the heart of the Castelli
          Romani, Tuscolum and Albani Hills south of Rome, and north
          of Lake Albano. The vineyards range from 200 to 1,000 feet
          in altitude. The soils are well drained and volcanic. The
          DOC allows for a minimum of 70% Malvasia (Bianca di Candia)
          and/or Malvasia del Lazio (aka Bombino) and a 30% maximum of
          Trebbiano and/or Greco and a maximum of 10% other white
          grapes. Many of the vineyards' cellars have ancient Roman
          caves. Modern cellars and techniques are now leading the way
          to an ever growing reputation of a fine quality wine, with
          many award winning labels. Frascati wine is also an
          ingredient in the Frascati Frizz aperitif.[1][2][3]
