          Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro - The smallest
          wine-producing region located south of the town of Modena.
          The region is home to Grasparossa of which the DOC requires
          85% of the wine to be composed of lambrusco. The wine of
          this region is typically dry and full bodied with a deep
          purplish-red coloring.[3] Grasparossa produces the most
          tannic Lambrusco.[1]
        </p>
        <p>
          Lambrusco Reggiano - The largest producing region of
          Lambrusco and the source of most of the exported DOC
          designated wines. The 4 Lambrusco grapes that can be used
          are Maestri, Marani, Montericco, and Salamino. Up to 15% of
          added Ancellotta grapes are permitted in the DOC as well.
          The sweet versions of the wine are typically in the light
          bodied frizzante style while the drier wines are more full
          bodied and darker in color.[3]

          Lambrusco Salamino di Santa Croce - Located 7 miles (11 km)
          west of the village Sorbara, the wines of this region must
          be composed of at least 90% of the local Salamino. The wines
          are typically light in color and body with a frizzante style
          being both made in both semi-sweet and dry styles.[3] The
          variety gets its name from the resemblance of the grape
          clusters to a sausage of salami.[4]
        </p>

          Lambrusco di Sorbara - Located north of Modena near the
          village of Sorbara, Sorbara is generally regarded as the
          highest quality variety producing the most fragrant wines.
          It has some similarities to Lambrusco Salamino but produces
          a darker and more full-bodied wine. The color can range from
          a deep ruby to a purplish hue. In this wine region only
          Sorbara and Salamino are permitted in the DOC designated
          wine with at least 60% needing to be Sorbara.[3] The
          Salamino and Sorbara varieties tend to produce the most
          acidic wines. One of the reasons why Sorbara tends to
          produce the highest quality Lambrusco is the tendency of the
          vine to drop its flowers, which reduces fruit yields and
          concentrates flavors.[1]
