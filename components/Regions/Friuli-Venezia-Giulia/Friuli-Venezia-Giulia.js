        Friuli-Venezia Giulia wine (or Friuli wine) is wine made in
        the northeastern Italian region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Once
        part of the Venetian Republic and with sections under the
        influence of the Austro-Hungarian Empire for some time, the
        wines of the region have noticeable Slavic and Germanic
        influences. There are 11 Denominazione di origine controllata
        (DOC) and 3 Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita
        (DOCG) in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia area. The region has 3
        Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) designations Alto Livenza,
        delle Venezie and Venezia Giulia. Nearly 62% of the wine
        produced in the region falls under a DOC designation. The area
        is known predominantly for its white wines which are
        considered some of the best examples of Italian wine in that
        style.[1] Along with the Veneto and Trentino-Alto
        Adige/SÃ¼dtirol, the Friuli-Venezia Giulia forms the Tre
        Venezie wine region which ranks with Tuscany and Piedmont as
        Italy's world class wine regions.[2]
