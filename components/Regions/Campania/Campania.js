        The major wines of Campania are Falanghina (a fresh, easygoing
        white), Aglianico (a full-bodied red made from the local grape
        variety), Piedirosso (a simple but tasty red wine), and
        Lacrima Christi ("tears of Christ", much of it made near
        Vesuvius). The most sumptuous wines come from Eastern
        Campania, such as the rich Taurasi, light Greco di Tufo, and
        floral Fiano di Avellino.
