          Calabrian wine (Italian: Vino Calabrese) is Italian wine
          from the Calabria region of southern Italy. Over 90% of the
          region's wine production is red wine, with a large portion
          made from the Gaglioppo grape. Calabria has 12 Denominazione
          di origine controllata (DOC) regions, but only 4% of the
          yearly production is classified as DOC wine. The region is
          one of Italy's most rural and least industrialized with per
          capita income less than half of the national average.[1]
          Following World War II, many of Calabria's inhabitants
          emigrated to Northern Italy, the United States, Australia
          and Argentina. Those left behind have been slow to develop a
          vibrant wine industry with only the red wines of Cir√≤
          garnering much international attention. Today Calabrian
          wines are mostly produced to high alcohol levels and sold to
          co-operatives who transfer the wines to the northern Italian
          wine regions to use as blending component. There are no
          Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG)
          regions, but Calabria does have 12 Indicazione Geografica
          Tipica (IGT) designations.[2]
