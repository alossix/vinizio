        The broader area comprising Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and
        Trentino-Alto Adige/SÃ¼dtirol is known collectively as the Tre
        Venezie, after the Republic of Venice. Veneto is the most
        populous and biggest denominazione di origine controllata
        (DOC) producer of the three regions. Although the Tre Venezie
        collectively produce more red wine than white, the Veneto
        region produces more whites under DOC and is notably home to
        the Prosecco and Soave wines.

        The region is protected from the harsh northern European
        climate by the Alps, the foothills of which form Veneto's
        northern extremes. These cooler climes are well-suited to
        white varieties like Garganega (the main grape for Soave
        wines),[1] while the warmer Adriatic coastal plains, river
        valleys, and Garda Lake zone are the places where the renowned
        Valpolicella, Amarone and Bardolino DOC reds are produced.

        In Veneto, two different wine areas are clearly
        distinguishable: an eastern part, close to the Venice Lagoon
        between the hills of Treviso, the plain of Piave river and
        Adriatic coast, where it is typical to produce the famous
        Prosecco (Glera), and other varieties are grown like Merlot,
        Carmenere, Verduzzo, Raboso Piave, Refosco, Tocai, Verdiso,
        Marzemino; and the western part, close to Garda Lake and the
        city of Verona, famous for the wines based on the varieties
        Corvina, Rondinella, Garganega, Trebbiano of Soave, and
        Oseleta.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the central part of Veneto the winemaking transitions
        between the varieties and styles of the Eastern and Western
        parts. In that area you can find the Colli Euganei, the hills
        close to Padua, that is a special Mediterranean microclimatic
        zone; it is even famous for the Moscato fior d'arancio
        production, a sparkling dessert wine.
      </p>

        Another area in the North-center of Veneto, close to Asiago,
        is Breganze, where the dessert wine Torcolato is produced with
        the Vespaiolo grape.
