        Aglianico is a black grape grown in the southern regions of
        Italy, mostly Basilicata and Campania. It is considered with
        Sangiovese and Nebbiolo to be one of the three greatest
        Italian varieties.[2] Aglianico is sometimes called "The
        Barolo of the South" (il Barolo del Sud) due to its ability to
        produce highly refined, complex fine wines like the famous
        Piedmont wine, Barolo.[3]

        In Basilicata, Aglianico is the basis of the Aglianico del
        Vulture DOC and the region's only DOCG wine, Aglianico del
        Vulture Superiore, concentrated in the northern area of the
        province of Potenza. The most sought-after productions come
        from the vineyards located in and around the extinct volcano
        Mount Vulture.
