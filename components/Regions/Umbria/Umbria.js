        Montefalco Sagrantino (also Sagrantino di Montefalco before
        2009) is a style of Italian wine made with 100% Sagrantino
        grapes in and around the comune of Montefalco in the Province
        of Perugia, Umbria.[2] The wines gained DOC status in 1979 as
        part of the Montefalco DOC and were later separately elevated
        to DOCG status in 1992 after a renewal of interest from
        winemakers, particularly Arnaldo Caprai. There are two DOCG
        wines: Montefalco Sagrantino Secco, an oak-aged dry red wine
        ("secco" is Italian for "dry"), and the less common Montefalco
        Sagrantino Passito, a sweet, dessert red wine.

        Under Italian law, the term "Montefalco Sagrantino Secco DOCG"
        defines a wine obtained exclusively from Sagrantino grapes,
        produced exclusively in a defined area around Montefalco in
        the Province of Perugia, in the Umbria region of central
        Italy. The defined area also includes areas around Giano
        dell'Umbria, Bevagna, Gualdo Cattaneo and Castel Ritaldi.[3]
        The wine must be aged for a minimum of 37 months, of which at
        least 12 months must be in oak barrels.[4] The combination of
        the very thick-skinned sagrantino grape and the long aging
        time in oak produces a typically very dense, full-bodied wine,
        with a very high tannin content. This makes for excellent
        storage characteristics, which are required since it is highly
        astringent when young, but improves with age.[2]
