          Abruzzo (Abruzzi) is an Italian wine region located in the
          mountainous central Italian region of Abruzzo along the
          Adriatic Sea. It is bordered by the Molise wine region to
          the south, Marche to the north and Lazio to the west.
          Abruzzo's rugged terrain, 65% of which is mountainous, help
          to isolate the region from the winemaking influence of the
          ancient Romans and Etruscans in Tuscany but the area has had
          a long history of wine production.

        <p>
          Today more than 22 million cases of wine are produced
          annually in Abruzzo, making it the seventh most productive
          region in Italy, but only 21.5% of which is made under the
          Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC)
          designation.[3][4][5] More than two-thirds of the region's
          wine is produced by co-operatives or sold in bulk to
          negociants in other Italian wine regions in Tuscany,
          Piedmont and the Veneto for blending.[1][2] The most notable
          wine of the region is Montepulciano d'Abruzzo produced with
          the Montepulciano grape that is distinct from the Sangiovese
          grape behind the Tuscan wine Vino Nobile di
          Montepulciano.[6] Together with Trebbiano d'Abruzzo,
          Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is one of the most widely exported
          DOC wine from Italy, particularly to the United States.

          While wine is produced in all four of Abruzzo's provinces,
          the bulk of the production takes place in the province of
          Chieti which is the fifth largest producing province in all
          of Italy. Some of the most highly rated wine from Abruzzo
          comes from the hillside vineyards in the northern provinces
          of Pescara and Teramo. In the completely mountainous
          province of L'Aquila in the west, some ros√© wine known as
          Cerasuolo from the Montepulciano grape is produced.
