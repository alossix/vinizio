        Verdicchio (/vɛərˈdiːkioʊ/, also US: /vɜːrˈ-, -kjoʊ,
        vɛərˈdɪkioʊ/,[1][2][3] Italian: [verˈdikkjo]) is a white
        Italian wine grape variety grown primarily in the Marche
        region of central Italy.[4] The name Verdicchio derives from
        verde (or "green") and refers to the slight green/yellow hue
        that wines made from the grape can have.[5]
      </p>
      <p>
        Verdicchio is the principal grape behind two Denominazione di
        Origine Controllata (DOC) wines produced in the provinces of
        Macerata and Ancona, Verdicchio di Matelica and Verdicchio dei
        Castelli di Jesi. In addition to producing still wines,
        Verdicchio grapes are also used to make sparkling wine and
        straw wine.[6]
